      <h2>Just a little bit about me and my goals.</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Logan, and I am here to make your life easier and not talk about technical stuffs (unless you want to).</p>
      <p>
        I’m from Brazil but don’t worry about our communication. I can speak English just fine. My goal here is to help you with your website without too much crazy stuff going on, just a simple and clean design that is very easy to go through.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to code and design I have a lot of fun doing it and also i love to help people, so i’m not just try to delivery something very fast to earn money, i hope that i can understand your needs and aply then to make a  nice design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, my work will be providing you with a designed and coded website that doesn’t include hosting etc. but if you do not know how this kind of stuff works, 
        I will be more than happy to guide you. If you want to know something else just message me.

      <h1>Faq</h1>
      <h2>I have to reach you on (name here)?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, currently i’m only working inside the platform (name here).
      </p>
      <h2>Why (name here)?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually this kind of work demands some bureaucracy like a contract to assure both parts are going to be safe about fraud, but with (name here) we don’t need to worry about this, the platform is going to take care of it for us and we can just discuss the work and move on faster. don’t worry signing up is free.
